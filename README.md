## Settings

### Dimensions
Define two date/time fields as dimensions. The first dimension is displayed along the x-axis and is a repetitive or seasonal element. For example, months in a year, days in a week or hours in a day. The second dimension describes the different instances of each repetitive or seasonal element. For example, years, weeks, or days, respectively.
